# 'The Anvil' Rock and Metal Pub


This website has been created for my User Centric Frontend Development Milestone 1 project, the first project on the [Code Institute Diploma in Software Development](https://codeinstitute.net/) course.
The aim of the project is to showcase my understanding of the initial modules of the course by building a static front-end website to present useful information to users, using HTML and CSS programming languages alongside optional frameworks such as Bootstrap.

This project is concerned with building a website for a fictitious pub called "The Anvil". This pub has a heavy metal and rock music theme, including hosting live band performances. The aim of the website is to firstly promote the pub on behalf of the owners by providing a user-friendly and informative website. Secondly, the website needs to provide valuable and easily digestible information to potential and existing customers.

## User Experience (UX)
---
This website will follow the principles of User Centred Design (UCD), which will focus on placing users at the centre of the design and development process.

This site has two principal user goals to consider.

1. **Site Business Owners** - in this case, the pub owners. The greatest value to the business will be achieved by aiming the site towards a consumer market. This will influence the approach taken, with a greater focus on emotive design with catchy and compelling content. Inspirational research has been undertaken by comparing websites of similar existing businesses and assessing what they are doing well but also what could be improved. See [Credits](#credits).

2. **Customer Users** - the main focus of the site will be on the potential and existing customer user base of the pub. As a licenced premise and the appeal of the music genre being widespread, the only real target user demographic would be over 18 year olds. However, it is expected that most users would rely on mobile devices to view the website. I am drawing on the experience of myself and friends as users of similar sites to create the user goals for this site.   



### Project Strategy
---
-   #### Business Goals

    * As the business owner, I want features and content that will engage new users quickly, encourage them to explore the site and draw them back in the future.
    * As the business owner, I want to advertise the great aspects of our business which make us special.
    * As the business owner, I want to project a positive image and for users to feel that they can trust us.
    * As the business owner, I want to make a connection with users and enable us to contact and be contacted by them.
    * As the business owner, I would like to be able to get customer user feedback to help identify where we are going right and where there is room for improvement.
    * As the business owner, I want to provide users with useful information without overloading them.
    * As the business owner, I want the site to be accessible to all users.
    

-   #### User Goals (general)

    * As a user, I want to be immediately drawn into the site and understand its main purpose.
    * As a user, I want to be able to easily identify what I need and navigate the site to get to it.
    * As a user, I want concise but informative content, displayed in an aesthetic manner.
    * As a user, I want to be able to view the site clearly and intuitively on different device sizes.
    * As a user, I expect the site to be fully accessible.
    
-   #### User Stories (customer users)

    * As a new visitor, I want to be quickly reassured that this site will be of interest to me.
    * As a new visitor, I want to be able to identify the content of the site and be able to easily navigate to areas of interest, such as the facilities and drink selection offered.
    * As a new visitor, I would like to know the experiences of previous customers to help evaluate whether it would be an experience that I would enjoy. 
    * As a new visitor, I would like easily located social media links so I can see the pub's following, visitor comments and any uploaded media. 
    * As a new or returning visitor, I would like to know opening times and contact information so that I can locate the pub and contact the owners if I require any further information. Many people prefer an easy to fill contact form rather than contacting by phone. 
    * As a returning visitor, I would like to view the range and prices of food and drink on offer plus information on upcoming live music.
    * As a frequent visitor, I would like to be kept informed of any new content, such as promotions or new live band dates. New content should be easily identified on the site plus I would like to sign up to be notified personally.
    * As a frequent visitor, I would like to be able to share my experiences and connect with other users on the site.
    * As a frequent visitor, I would like there to be the option of accompanying music and videos, in line with the pub theme, to add to my user experience.

### Project Scope
---
Looking at the User and Business Goals, there are plenty of features and content which could be included in the site to attempt to satisfy all their needs. However, a number of factors limit what would be possible or desirable to include in the first development stage.

The main constraints are time and the current technological expertise of the developer. The decisions made at this stage are designed to avoid making the scope too large, such that the project becomes overloaded and fails to meet deadlines or making it too small, such that there is an unimpressive end result.  

The first development stage aims to create a Minimal Viable Product, providing users with the core requirements that they actually need. Additional features can be added at future developmental stages, once feedback has been received from the initial site features. 

The features to include in this first development stage will be determined by creating a strategy trade-off table, drawing on the user goals and needs.

#### Strategy Trade-offs

Opportunity | Importance | Viability
----------- | ---------- | ---------
Clear and intuitive navigational links | 5 | 5
Social media links | 5 | 5
Live music and event page | 5 | 5
Food and drink page | 4 | 5
Display opening times, facilities and contact details| 5 | 5
Contact form for users | 4 | 5
Feedback form for users and owners | 4 | 5
User reviews | 4 | 5
Responsive for all device sizes | 5 | 5
Showcase deals and promotions | 4 | 4
Create an online blog | 3 | 1
Gallery to showcase pub nights | 3 | 3
Jukebox set up for users to play music videos | 2 | 1
Shop page to sell merchandise | 2 | 1

The higher feasilbility elements will be incorporated in this first stage of development. 

#### Content Scope
As seen on the site logo, the motto is "Forging Great Beer and Music". It is therefore important to dedicate resources towards highlighting these two elements in the first stage of the site i.e. showcasing the beer and the music which is on offer, as this will be expected by users.

It is felt that most users of the site will be visiting to look for particular information. The site is for a public house in a fixed location which caters in the most part for fans of a specific music genre. Visitors to the site, be they first time, returning or frequent, will therefore most likely have an idea of the general purpose of the site before visiting. 

It is for the above reasons that the site should not be overloaded with peripheral content, such as long background stories. The content structure will instead focus purely on useful and concise content for the user without obscuring it with extraneous material. 


### Project Structure
---

The structural design of the site aims to make the user interaction with the site as easy and as comfortable as possible. This is achieved by creating meaningful relationships between the various site elements so that users can intuitively understand their meaning and purpose.

The principles of Interactive Design (IxD) promote consistency, predictability, visibility, learnability and feedback as central to the above aim. The structure of this site aims to follow these principles.

-   #### Page Structure
    - Drawing on personal experience and further research of websites for similar organisations, it is felt that a multiple page site would suit best. This is consistent with a user's previous experiences and the predictability will make them more comfortable with the site.
    - The 'Home' page will immediately address some of the user goals, with clear directions to desired content through navigation links, calls to action and meaningful images. These are again consistent with previous user experiences.
    - Some user goals can be addressed in small sections on the 'Home' page, such as venue facilities. Links to these sections will be grouped under an 'About' navigation link, with the individual sections appearing as dropdown links.
    - The beer and the music are the main selling points for the site. These therefore warrant their own pages. These particular sections of similar websites are usually big enough and important enough to warrant their own page so again this is consistent and predictable. 
    - A separate 'Contact' page is also expected. This allows for a contact form which also provides feedback and sign up opportunities to be included alongside direct contact details, location information (including a map) and opening hours. Including these on the 'Home' page or as a pop-up modal could lead to information overload so a separate page is preferred.
    - Each page will have the same header and footer. This consistency is visually pleasing to the user and they also quickly learn how these elements act on each page, leading to a better user experience.
    - Time permitting, it is the intention to create a separate 404 error page in the event of a broken link or server error. This feedback adds reassurance to the user and provides them with clear instructions on how to return to the site.

-   #### Visibility
    - The location and purpose of elements should be clear to users. Ideally, a scroll down button to show users that there is content further down the page would be used. However, this involves the use of JavaScript, which is currently beyond the scope of the developer. Instead, there will be partial overlay of elements on the screens to hint to the user that there is more content below.
    - Dropdown menus will have an arrow to indicate that there are further options available. This is a common practice to make elements more visible so should be predictable to the user. If not, the consistent use of this practice will help the user to learn what such arrows mean and be comfortable navigating the pages.

-   #### Navigation
    - The site navigation will again be consistent and predictable by following the convention of the site logo on the top left with a horizontal navigation bar to the right of the logo. There will also be a 'Sign Up' button on the top right hand side. As there is not a large number of pages to navigate through, this is the most appropriate method. Only the 'About' link requires a dropdown so the user will only need two clicks at most to reach their destination. Should the site evolve in the future, a more appropriate navigation system could be considered. 
    - It is felt that a sticky navigation bar will provide the best user experience. As all navigation links are available on the navigation bar, this will enable the user to move around without having to scroll up each time.
    - The navigation bar will be responsive and will use a hamburger menu for smaller devices. This is consistent and predictable with most sites on mobile devices. The menu will then cover the page when activated to maximise visibility of the options.

-   #### Buttons and Links
    - Buttons and links will be used to create a smoother navigation process for the user. The purpose of these must be made clear to the user. Buttons and links will react when the mouse hovers over them. This conventionally suggests that clicking on the button or link will make something happen. The use of unambiguous text or iconography will make it clear to the user what will happen when the button or link is clicked.
    - Styling the buttons and links in a consistent manner and employing the same reaction when e.g. the mouse hovers will help the user to learn and predict what they need to do to achieve their goals.
    - When a button is clicked, the user will be provided with some feedback to reassure them that their action has been acknowledged. This will be either a change in the button appearance or a confirmation message. This builds trust with the user.

-   #### Iconography
    - Icons will be used to help users to quickly identify content matter. A visual representation can say more than words and often stands out more. A quick scan of the page will pick out icons and well chosen ones will stand out and immediately assure the user as to the associated content.
    - The site logo acts in a similar fashion and the user quickly learns to associate the image with the site and its purpose. A favicon, using a version of the logo, will be also be added. This is now generally expected by users and helps them to identify the site if they have several pages open.     
 

### Project Design
---
The layout and content of the site has been designed with the User Experience at the forefront. The typical user will be someone interested in rock/heavy metal music and socialising. The site therefore needs to engage with this type of user and try to draw them in. The design needs to be energetic, a little unconventional and fun.

- #### General Layout
    - The design will broadly follow the 'rule of thirds' to provide a visually comforting experience to the user. Where appropriate, sections will be divided into thirds or one-third to two-thirds ratios.
    - Sizings of elements will be balanced and proportional to again improve the visual comfort of the site. Where appropriate, widths and heights will be sized in multiples of 150px. 
    - Layouts will be responsive to different screen sizes, particularly as many users will be expected to view the site on mobile devices. Consequently, the layout will change according to media size e.g. three horizontal columns on a desktop may become three vertical columns on a mobile phone.
    

-   #### Colour Scheme
    - The colour scheme for this site is very important in making the user feel immediately comfortable. Heavy metal music is synonymous with dark colours, with album covers and clothing most often a black background with lighter text. Users will expect such colours and this will be consistent with previous user experiences.
    - The headers and footers will be white copy on a black background. Deep purple will also be used, chosen for its visuals and for it also being the name of a pioneering British rock/heavy metal band. These will be complemented by lighter grey, yellow and orange tones for text and buttons.
    - The main colours will be

      #000 - Black

      [#36013f](https://icolorpalette.com/color/deep-purple) - Deep Purple

      [#e2b659](https://icolorpalette.com/color/e2b659) - Light Orange Shade

      [#f9f871](https://icolorpalette.com/color/f9f871) - Yellow Shade

      [f5f5f5](https://icolorpalette.com/color/f5f5f5) - Light Grey Shade

      #fff - White

    - The chosen colours have been checked with [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure that the colour contrasts meet accessibility guidelines. 
 

-   #### Typography
    - The font choices for the site will again consider the user and remain consistent with their experiences and expectations. The writing on heavy metal posters, clothing and websites has an instantly recognisable and associative look, which this site will aim to reproduce.
    -   [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) has a [Metal Mania](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Metal+Mania?preview.text=opening%20hours&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) font which will be used for headings. It is not the intention to overuse this font so it will be used for `h1` and `h2` headings. [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?preview.text=Contact%20Us&preview.text_type=custom&query=mon#about) will be used for other headings and the main body text. Montserrat is a clean and popular font but also has an urban feel to it so is ideal for the site. Montserrat will also act as a websafe font for Metal Mania, as the latter may not be universally supported. Sans serif will act as a fallback font in case the chosen fonts are not imported correctly.

-   #### Imagery
    -   Imagery will be an important factor in making the user feel at ease. As the average user will be visiting the site for specific information, they will not want to be subjected to large blocks of text. Rather, rock/heavy metal and pub imagery is more important to make the user feel at ease, alongside clear access to the information they seek.
    - Each page, other than the Contact page, will have a hero image to catch the user's attention and draw them into the page. The image will be relevant to the contents of each specific page. This is consistent, predictable and learnable, thus helping to achieve a positive emotional response in the user.

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to action button.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image
        3. The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new programming challenges or hackathons.

        1. These are clearly shown in the banner message.
        2. They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
        2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.

        4. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
        5. The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.
        1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
        2. Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
        3. If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added challenges or hackathons.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.
